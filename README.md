with presets for rendering icons for iOS, MacOS and Android

## usage

    usage: pdf2png -i <input.pdf> [-o <output-file-prefix>] [-s @,@2x,50,100x50,100@2x,400%]
        [-t ios|android-small|macos-small|android-large|ios-small|macos|ios-large|android|macos-large|retina]

    -i      - input file name, a PDF
    -o      - output file prefix, to which the size and .png will be appended
    -s      - a comma seperated array of output sizes
    -t      - a target group, which outputs a set of sizes suitable for icons
    -a YES  - include alpha channel, YES or NO
    
    # TODO Options

    -b 8    - bits per channel, default is 8
    -c 3    - channels 1 or 3 (2 or 4?)
    -m RGB  - model
    -z N    - crush, generate the smallest PNG possible over N iterations

## sizes

Output sizes can be expressed in a number of formats:

    @       - Original Size
    @2x     - Retina Sizes
    50      - Square Sizes (50x50)
    100x50  - Rectangular Sizes
    100@2x  - Square Retina Sizes (200,200)
    400%   - Percentage Sizes

## example

You have a logo for an application which is square with large and small variants that you want to render for iOS and Android:

    pdf2png -i app-logo-small.pdf -o app-logo -t ios-small

Is equivalent to:

    > pdf2png -i app-logo-small.pdf -o app-logo -s 29,29@2x,29@3x,40,40@2x,40@3x
    pdf2png wrote [29 x 29] pixels to app-logo_29x29.png
    pdf2png wrote [58 x 58] pixels to app-logo_29x29@2x.png
    pdf2png wrote [87 x 87] pixels to app-logo_29x29@3x.png
    pdf2png wrote [40 x 40] pixels to app-logo_40x40.png
    pdf2png wrote [80 x 80] pixels to app-logo_40x40@2x.png
    pdf2png wrote [120 x 120] pixels to app-logo_40x40@3x.png

To complete the set you can run:

    > pdf2png -i app-logo-small.pdf -o app-logo -t android-small
    pdf2png wrote...
    
    > pdf2png -i app-logo-large.pdf -o app-logo -t ios-large
